# Concepts

Working definitions and developing ideas:

## Consequence Design
Designing with awareness of downstream effects and systemic influence.

## Interaction Architecture
Designing how people move through complex, shifting systems — making decisions visible and interpretable.

## Critical Delivery
Building systems with intentional friction, transparency, and care — resisting interface smoothness that hides institutional harm.

## AI Experience (AX)
Shaping humane, legible, accountable experiences with machine agents.
