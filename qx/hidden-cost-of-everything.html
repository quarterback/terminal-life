      <h2 class="article-title">The Hidden Cost of Everything</h2>
      <p class="byline">Originally written around 2018</p>

      <p>I ordered a pizza. Normally I pick it up. But I was tired, so I had it delivered.</p>

      <p>The delivery driver thanked me profusely when I tipped in cash. Then she texted again to say thanks—turns out she was working for DoorDash. I didn’t order from DoorDash. I ordered directly from a local shop. But the shop outsourced delivery to a third-party system without saying so.</p>

      <p>This bothered me. Not because I didn’t want to use DoorDash, but because I had no idea they were part of the transaction. There was no transparency. No consent. No way for me to know how the driver was being paid—or whether they’d see a dime of the money I tipped online.</p>

      <p>That’s why I tipped in cash. And clearly, that made a difference to the driver.</p>

      <p>This isn’t just a story about pizza. It’s a reflection on how consequence design is ignored in everyday economic interfaces. There's an entire layer of subcontracted, low-visibility infrastructure reshaping how service work happens—and it’s mostly invisible to users.</p>

      <p>Technologists love the idea of “frictionless” experiences. But who absorbs the friction?</p>

      <p>The answer is often the gig worker, the underpaid courier, the invisible laborer who makes the convenience possible. While product teams enjoy six-figure salaries and equity stakes, those carrying out the service are a car accident away from financial ruin.</p>

      <p>Just because someone isn’t your neighbor doesn’t mean you shouldn’t care about the systems they’re subjected to. And when we run our user interviews—who are we designing for, really?</p>
