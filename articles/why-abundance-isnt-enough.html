      <p class="byline">By Tristen B. Vornanen — April 2025</p>

      <div class="callout"><strong>Parasitarchy:</strong> A system where power operates by attaching itself to democratic institutions while hollowing them from within. It maintains the appearance of legitimacy while displacing accountability.</div>

      <p>In <em>Abundance</em>, Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson present a gleaming vision of the future built on deregulated infrastructure, innovation-at-scale, and technocratic efficiency. But their blueprint reads less like a democratic manifesto and more like a corporate white paper wrapped in nostalgic optimism. What’s marketed as progress feels more like a retrofit of Reagan-era logic in a startup hoodie.</p>

      <p>Rather than confronting the structural causes of dysfunction, <em>Abundance</em> opts to diagnose symptoms. Bureaucratic drag, permitting delays, and litigation are treated as the enemies of modernity, while power asymmetries, capitalist capture, and racialized disinvestment never make the footnotes. What emerges isn’t a plan for collective flourishing—it’s a carefully tuned interface that preserves the illusion of democratic progress while rerouting authority to private actors.</p>

      <p>The book’s silence on race is deafening. How can one write about abundance in a country where entire zip codes—often majority-Black or immigrant—lack basic institutions like banks, grocery stores, or car dealerships? Where rural America, for all its poverty, often has more infrastructure than many urban centers? Where economic mobility is mapped neatly over the remnants of redlining?</p>

      <div class="callout"><strong>Selective Visibility:</strong> What gets labeled as inefficiency—zoning laws, environmental review—often impedes capital. What doesn't—military bloat, racialized exclusion—is simply ignored.</div>

      <p>It’s no accident that Klein and Thompson frame "democracy by lawsuit" as the problem. Lawsuits are one of the few remaining levers of public redress—especially for communities locked out of decision-making. But in the abundance worldview, they’re just more friction.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the structural culprits—like the financialization of housing, or the deliberate erosion of public sector capacity—remain untouched. It’s not that the authors endorse these forces. It’s that their framework cannot perceive them. Their abundance is interface-deep.</p>

      <blockquote>The interface becomes both mask and weapon, selectively applied to maintain order without justice.</blockquote>

      <p>Critics like Malcolm Harris and Dylan Gyauch-Lewis rightly note that this vision of the future is haunted by a refusal to name its political enemies. At best, it's a confused blend of neoliberalism’s language with technocratic reformism. At worst, it’s a permission slip for the oligarch class to further insulate themselves from the demands of democratic governance.</p>

      <p>The real tragedy is that we need an abundance agenda. But not one defined by metrics and logistics. We need one that can name the ways capital subverts planning, that centers justice over throughput, and that doesn’t outsource our collective imagination to TED Talk elites.</p>

      <p>Compare it with the vision of solar communism offered by David and Peter Schwartzman—an eco-socialist roadmap grounded in peace, equity, and democratic control of infrastructure. Their enemies aren’t permits or lawsuits. Their enemies are war, extraction, and capital.</p>

      <div class="callout"><strong>Reality Check:</strong> We’re not returning to a bottled-up version of the 1990s. The post-Cold War consensus is broken. Nostalgia is not a policy.</div>

      <p>Moderates want to perfume the past. Doctorow calls everything enshittification. Meanwhile, libertarians, tech moguls, and conservative revivalists conspire to gut the remnants of the New Deal. The clock won’t turn back, and the future won’t be summoned through VC-funded optimism. The failures we’re living through were designed. The world we’re inheriting isn’t broken by accident—it’s functioning exactly as intended.</p>

      <p>The question isn't whether we can build. It's whether we can plan. Democratically. Equitably. And in the face of the parasitarchies that now govern us through frictionless, faceless systems that serve the few.</p>

      <blockquote>To get anywhere worth going, we must reclaim the capacity to name the system—and imagine something better.</blockquote>
