    <p><strong>Governance has become a UX problem—intentionally, structurally, and perhaps permanently.</strong></p>
    <p>Systems don’t break, they reveal. What we mistake for digital efficiency is often just institutional abdication behind a button.</p>
    <p>The interface is now where law is interpreted. Where service delivery is judged. Where failure hides inside frictionless flows.</p>
    <blockquote>The interface didn’t glitch. It obeyed power.</blockquote>
    <p>To resist this means understanding systems not as broken—but as functioning precisely as intended.</p>
